# jupyter-tutorial
### A Jupyter Notebook tutorial for the Nuclear and Particle Physics course at Durham University.

These files will take you through how to use the jupyter notebooks provided as part of the NPP course. If you have any questions, please address them in your workshops or to your lecturer directly.

These notebooks are designed to work on the Scotgrid system only. To use them at home, you will need to also download the [npp module](https://github.com/danielmaitre/NPP) and place it in this directory.
